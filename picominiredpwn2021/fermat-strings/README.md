# Fermat-Strings

## Description

I didn't play this CTF, well I was not even knowing what CTF was at that time. This is a binary exploitation challenges involving GOT overwrites I came across in picoGym. I was not familiar with this exploit technique, so I was giving it a try after grabbing the concept from a very well-written write up here. [David's Write-up about Fermat-Strings](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2021_picoCTF_redpwn/fermat-strings.md) So why am I here? Because while I was reading his write-ups, I thought using A alone could work well. I decided to give it a try as my first GOT exploit chall, while at the same time testing using A only. I am not going to explain anything furthere here, as it is very clearly explained in the referenced write-up above. I am putting my exploit code here, there are two things to notice in my code that I would like to highlight.

### Advantage of using B for storing addresses instead of A

By using B to save addresses, the offset is always the same, which is 43 as mentioned from David' writeup. By using A, this offset will depend on the length of payload before the addresses, so it is more complicated.

### 2 Methods of generating payload

I used two different methods to create the format string payload to overwrite addresses, either manually or by tweaking the payload generated by `fmtstr_payload`.
