## Description

This is a Unity challenge in reverse & crypto category. I am not going to cover the reverse part here as it is done by my teammate. I am putting my crypto solve script here only.

## Solve

This is a xorshift128 algorithm. There was a very similar challenge in imaginary daily CTF (moonjump) which was the lua PRNG using xorshiro256. I started from the code template there, and modify it with the help of a rust repository of the actual algorithm.

Also credit to author TWY with the solve idea so I was writing this complete solve script, after the event. So...just check out the solve script.
